How to use:

Run ```python app.py``` to start the Flask server.

You can use tools like ```Postman``` or ```curl``` to interact with your API:

* ```POST /students``` to add a new student.
* ```GET /students``` to list all students.
* ```GET /students/<id>``` to get a specific student.
* ```PUT /students/<id>``` to update a specific student.
* ```DELETE /students/<id>``` to delete a specific student.
